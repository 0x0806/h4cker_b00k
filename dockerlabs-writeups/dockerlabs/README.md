# Dockerlabs

In this directory I will upload the WriteUps of the DockerLabs platform machines. At DockerLabs, you can download controlled environments in Docker that are automatically deployed with a bash script. These environments are ideal for practicing ethical hacking and pentesting.

## What is DockerLabs?

[DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com) is a platform that provides Docker-based lab environments specifically designed for learning and practicing cybersecurity skills. These environments are pre-configured with a variety of applications and configurations that contain known vulnerabilities so that users can safely experiment and learn about them.

* [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com): Official DockerLabs website where you can find more information about the platform and access lab environments.
* **Machines\*/**: Each file will be labeled with the name of the corresponding machine and will contain the step-by-step solution.
