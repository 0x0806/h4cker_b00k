# TheHackersLabs

In this directory, I will upload the WriteUps for the challenges from The Hackers Labs platform. The Hackers Labs provides a controlled web environment designed for practicing ethical hacking and bug bounty hunting. These labs are perfect for learning about real-world web vulnerabilities in a safe and legal setting.

## <mark style="color:purple;">**What is The Hackers Labs?**</mark>

The Hackers Labs is an interactive platform that offers realistic web security labs to help security researchers, ethical hackers, and bug bounty hunters improve their skills. Each lab contains web applications with known vulnerabilities, allowing users to practice exploiting security flaws such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF, and more. The platform is a great resource for those looking to train for bug bounty programs and learn how to find and report security vulnerabilities.

### **The Hackers Labs Resources**

* **The Hackers Labs Official Website**: The official site where you can find more information and access the labs. ([thehackerslabs.com](https://thehackerslabs.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Lab Directories**:
  * **Windows/**: Labs focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows systems.
  * **Linux/**: Labs dedicated to exploiting vulnerabilities in Linux systems.
  * **Android/**: Labs centered on exploiting vulnerabilities in Android applications.
  * **Web/**: Labs addressing common vulnerabilities in web applications.
  * **Pivoting/**: Labs teaching pivoting techniques to move laterally within a compromised network.
  * **Reversing/**: Labs focused on reverse engineering and analyzing binaries.
  * **Wireless/**: Labs exploring vulnerabilities in wireless networks.
  * **Forensics/**: Labs focused on digital evidence collection and forensic analysis.

Each directory will contain files labeled with the corresponding challenge name and its step-by-step solution (WriteUp) for exploiting the vulnerabilities.
